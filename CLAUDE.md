  ## Server vs. Client Components

  The codebase follows a clear separation between server and 
  client components:

  - **Server Components** (.tsx files) - Handle data fetching, 
  SEO, and initial rendering
  - **Client Components** (.client.tsx files) - Handle 
  interactivity, state, and client-side logic

  This separation optimizes performance by keeping data 
  fetching on the server and UI interactions on the client.

  ## Code Style Guidelines
  - **TypeScript**: Use strict typing, avoid `any` types
  - **File Structure**: Follow Next.js App Router conventions
  - **Imports**: Use `@/` alias for imports (e.g., 
  `@/components`, `@/lib`)
  - **Components**: React functional components with explicit 
  type definitions
  - **Styling**: Use Tailwind CSS with `cn` utility from 
  `@/lib/utils` for class merging
  - **UI Components**: Follow shadcn/ui patterns with variants 
  via cva
  - **Naming**: PascalCase for components, camelCase for 
  functions/variables
  - **Error Handling**: Use try/catch with descriptive error 
  messages
  - **State Management**: Use React hooks and XState for state 
  machines
  - **ESLint**: Follow Next.js core web vitals and TypeScript 
  rules
  - **Format**: Use 2-space indentation, single quotes for 
  strings
  - **Documentation**: Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
   and components
  - **Framer Motion**: Use for animations and transitions

  ## Environment Variables

  The application uses environment variables for configuration,
   which are exposed to the client via the Next.js config:

  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` - Google Maps API key for
   geocoding and map display
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` - Supabase URL for database 
  connection
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` - Supabase anonymous key 
  for public access

  When adding new environment variables, make sure to update 
  `next.config.ts` if they need to be exposed to the client.

  ## Working with Dynamic Routes
  - Always reference dynamic paths like `[customerUuid]` 
  properly to avoid errors
  - When working with file paths containing special characters 
  (like brackets []), enclose the path in double quotes to 
  prevent shell pattern expansion
  - Example: `./scripts/create-component-prompt.sh 
  "src/app/proposal/[customerUuid]/components/sections/PoolSele
  ctionCards/DetailsCard.tsx"`

  ## State Management

  The application uses a state machine for navigation between 
  sections:

  - `sectionMachine.ts` defines the state machine logic
  - The state machine tracks the current section and subsection
  - Navigation is handled through `next()` and `prev()` 
  functions
  - `uniqueSections` are computed based on the snapshot data to
   determine available sections

  ## Animation Patterns

  The application uses Framer Motion for animations:

  - `animation.ts` contains shared animation variants
  - `AnimatePresence` is used for mounting/unmounting 
  animations
  - `motion` components are used for animating elements
  - Animations are coordinated via `lastDir` for 
  direction-aware transitions

  ## Responsive Design

  The application is fully responsive with a mobile-first 
  approach:

  - Mobile layout uses stacked columns and simplified UI
  - Desktop layout uses side-by-side columns with enhanced UI
  - Breakpoints follow Tailwind's default system:
    - `lg:` for desktop (1024px and above)
    - Default for mobile and tablet

  ## Media Handling

  The application optimizes media assets for performance:

  - Images use Next.js Image component with appropriate sizing
  - Videos use a custom ResponsiveVideo component that selects 
  appropriate format based on browser support
  - Media is organized by category in the `/public` directory
  - Optimization scripts are provided for images and videos

  ## Proposal Components Structure

  The proposal viewer is organized into sections:

  1. **Main Layout**:
     - Fixed Header
     - Main Content (Left + Right columns)
     - Fixed Footer with progress indicator

  2. **Left Column (Content)**:
     - Customer Info (Welcome)
     - Pool Selection
     - Site Requirements (Pool Installation)
     - Filtration & Maintenance
     - Concrete & Paving
     - Fencing
     - Retaining Walls
     - Water Feature
     - Add-Ons (Extras & Upgrades)

  3. **Right Column (Visual)**:
     - Context-sensitive visuals (images, videos, maps)
     - Changes based on active section
     - Interactive elements like the quote price card and site 
  plan

  4. **Navigation**:
     - Section selection dropdown
     - Next/Previous buttons
     - Progress indicator

  ## Database Integration
  - The application uses Supabase for data storage
  - SQL views provide consolidated data (`proposal_snapshot_v`)
  - Data is fetched server-side in 
  `getProposalSnapshot.server.ts`
  - Types in `types/snapshot.ts` define the shape of data 
  returned from the view

  ### Data Flow
  1. The proposal page (`/proposal/[customerUuid]/page.tsx`) 
  fetches data using `getProposalSnapshot`
  2. Data is retrieved from a Supabase database view named 
  `proposal_snapshot_v`
  3. The snapshot data is passed to the client component 
  (`ProposalViewer.client.tsx`)
  4. The client renders different sections based on the data 
  and user navigation

  ## Data Structure and Migration
  Current implementation has two data structures:

  1. **SQL View Structure (New)**: 
     - Direct SQL view mapping with flat, snake_case properties
   (e.g., `spec_name`, `home_address`)
     - Defined in `/src/app/lib/types/snapshot.ts` as 
  `ProposalSnapshot`
     - Used by the server-side data fetching in 
  `getProposalSnapshot.server.ts`

  2. **Component Structure (Legacy)**:
     - Nested object structure with camelCase properties (e.g.,
   `poolSpecification.name`, `poolProject.homeAddress`)
     - Previously defined in the old `snapshot.ts` file (before
   the recent changes)
     - Still expected by all client-side components

  ### Migration Approach
  We are refactoring components one by one to use the new flat 
  SQL view structure directly. 

  **IMPORTANT**: 
  - Use snake_case in component code to match the SQL view 
  property names
  - Adhere to the flat structure - don't recreate nested 
  objects
  - Standard TypeScript best practices are less important than 
  consistency with the database fields
  - When refactoring a component, update the import to use the 
  new `ProposalSnapshot` type

  ### Financial Calculations
  Previously separated calculations have now been integrated:

  - **Base Pool Costs**: Combines fixed costs, variable costs, 
  and shell cost
  - **Base Pool Price**: Calculated using the formula: `Cost รท 
  (1 - margin %)`
  - **Installation Costs**: Include electrical, traffic 
  control, bobcat, and crane costs
